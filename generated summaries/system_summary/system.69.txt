Article: 
it was on @entity1 last year that @entity2 finally cracked after being substituted by @entity4 manager @entity3 at @entity5
he had done his utmost not to react and , placid by nature , there was no kicking water bottles , but he was visibly distraught despite the consolatory efforts of @entity11 behind him
fast forward 0months and there was an altogether different kind of substitution in the 81st minute of last sunday 's @entity15
after scoring and inspiring @entity17 to 0- 0win , he received a standing ovation and a pat on the back from @entity22
@entity17 midfielder @entity2 turns away to celebrate after scoring against @entity23 @entity2 had scored @entity17 's third goal during the 0- 0victory over their bitter rivals at @entity27 last week @entity2 looks dejected after being substituted by @entity4 boss @entity3 last year at @entity28 although he had been a popular figure at @entity4 , @entity2 could not convince @entity3 to keep hold of him @entity31 is finally getting the best out of @entity2
in his last five games , the @entity33 has performed better than he ever has in the @entity35 : @entity2 is performing at the peak of his powers he is not surprised by the turnaround in his own , and the team 's , fortunes -- he began the season believing @entity17 could win the league this year with no @entity44 commitments
he told @entity45 last may : ' if we take @entity48 as the example there you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish without the @entity55
' he was mocked for the optimism but if @entity17 beat @entity4 at @entity28 they will be only five points behind the leaders
when @entity60 was manager , he and assistant @entity59 had scouted @entity61 for the ' @entity62 ' they believed the team needed before it became clear @entity17 could get the real thing
when @entity31 arrived , @entity2 took one step forward and two back
the early tinkering often meant he played in his favoured position behind the front two , but the three - man defence experiment undermined everything else the team did and results were poor
he ended up back where he had been at @entity4 under @entity3 -- on the bench
@entity2 missed the football he had played earlier in his career at @entity77 and under @entity78 at @entity4
the free spirit was being shackled and the only consolation was that others felt the same , none more so than @entity83 , the player he is closest to at the club
the two had won an under 0@entity86 together with @entity87 where they had enjoyed a freedom of expression now denied them
@entity83 , like @entity2 , was out of the side
when i interviewed him in 0before the @entity55 final he insisted on meeting in a @entity96 cafe because it was where he felt most at home
now he was in a mansion in @entity99 , south @entity100
as @entity17 's fortunes changed on the pitch , however , so @entity2 's season has been saved
with @entity105 now planted in front of a back four , the side has the balance to allow its creative players to thrive
@entity2 is not in his favoured no 0position but he is also comfortable on the right
' i can come inside on my left foot and see the whole of the pitch in front of me , ' he says
@entity2 enjoys a close friendship with fellow @entity119 midfielder and @entity87 international @entity83 -lrb- right -rrb- @entity2 scores the second of his two goals against @entity48 at @entity122 this season , a stunning overhead kick it is the same left foot @entity22 joked about with him when he joined , saying he was glad to see him arrive but unhappy that he no longer possessed the best left peg at @entity27
the relationship with @entity22 is healthy , as is the one struck up with @entity129
