it 's every chocoholic 's dream come true - a mountain of @entity5 eggs covering the entire house
but while @entity7 - pictured among the treats - does have two chocolate - loving daughters , this incredible bounty is not for them
@entity11 , 0, and @entity12 , five , lost their eight - year - old brother @entity13 last year to a mystery illness , and when @entity5 approached they decided to donate all their eggs to the patients at @entity19 where he was cared for
@entity7 - pictured among the treats - has two chocolate - loving daughters but this incredible bounty is not for them
instead the eggs will be donated to @entity19 once the family , from @entity23 , @entity24 , posted on @entity25 , kind strangers began to send eggs - and now there are more than 1,000
some donations have come from as far afield as the @entity29 , with many from @entity31 and @entity32 and the length and breadth of @entity35
the girls came up with the inspirational idea after spending three easters in a row by @entity13 's side at the hospital where they were all lucky enough to receive @entity42
@entity11 said : ' i thought it was going to be never - ending ! it feels really nice to remember him and i do n't think the hospital were expecting as many
@entity47 , 0, and @entity48 -lrb- both above with mother @entity50 -rrb- , five , came up with the idea in memory of their brother @entity13 ' it feels a bit strange at the moment
i 've never had this much chocolate in my house before
' their 0- year - old mother , who was a full - time carer for @entity13 and now works as a support worker for disabled children , said : ' i was taken aback by it all
we did n't expect to get the response that we did
it 's really touching what the girls are doing
' they were really close to @entity13 , they had a really tight bond
the hospital think it 's amazing and a really nice thing to do
' on the second day i thought 0eggs was an amazing response but when it continued the girls were a bit overwhelmed by it all and a bit speechless
the eggs are still arriving
it feels really good to be able to give something back
