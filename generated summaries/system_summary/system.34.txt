@entity1 star @entity0 believes the pain of @entity5 's @entity4 exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season 's @entity10 play - offs
@entity0 and company were left to reflect on what might have been at @entity15 's @entity14 as six @entity17 penalties gave three - time @entity20 champions @entity18 a tense 0- 0quarter - final success
@entity5 dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly - half @entity25 and captain @entity27 , but hopes of reaching a first top - flight @entity20 semi-final since 0floundered on their indiscipline
@entity0 carries during an impressive @entity5 performance , but the @entity34 side came up short attention will now quickly return to the @entity10 , with @entity5 having four games left - against @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 - in the quest for a top - four finish
' the overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed , ' said @entity5 full - back @entity0 , whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched @entity18 defence
' to have battled out of the group as we did -lrb- @entity5 lost their first two games -rrb- and then obviously to get into the quarter - final , to get so close and then fail at the end , it is obviously massively disappointing
' but we have to try to take the positives , and i think a disappointment like this is going to help us in the @entity10
' @entity5 stayed true to the ball - in - hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season 's @entity10 campaign , and at times , @entity18 struggled to cope
@entity17 was perfect from the tee to hand @entity18 the victory in a game where they were second best in @entity17 , though , they had a relentless marksman , whose 0per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent @entity18 marching on and @entity5 left to focus solely on domestic matters
' to put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like @entity18 is just going to add more confidence , ' @entity0 added
' i think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of , and i have really enjoyed playing for this club
' i think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome
i think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction
