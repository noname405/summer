Article: 
overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best
but it becomes completely believable when it is brought to life through the inspirational , optimistic , comeback story of a charismatic , beautiful , young woman named @entity7
@entity7 cast a spell through her endearing vulnerability and charming personality , collecting an enormous social media following who were enamoured with her brave account of reclaiming her health
wellness warrior @entity7 has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness now that @entity7 has admitted she made her story up , we ask ourselves , how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle , without a shred of supporting evidence ? the answer is very simple
and we did not so much believe in @entity25 ´ s story , as we believed in @entity25
everyone loves a heart - warming account of overcoming the odds
we were enchanted by @entity25 s journey , as well as by @entity7 herself
a beautiful , young , inspirational woman , we fell in love with her story as well as with her -- which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel
here are five ways that the @entity7 ´ s of the world win us over
she founded the @entity45 - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded appearances are reality -- and @entity51 believe it or not , studies show that people can not distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive
this causes us to make the easier judgement -- that other people are truthful
to make matters worse , when we like someone , we are likely to believe they are truthful , even when they are lying
how do we overcome the truthfulness bias ? one way is to closely examine a person ´ s motives
when someone relays a heart - warming story , as @entity7 did , what is she getting out of it ? while many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion , examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light
@entity80 says we fell for @entity7 because ' we love heartwarming stories -- especially comeback stories ' born to @entity84 - there is a bit of @entity7 in @entity86 we love heart - warming stories -- especially comeback stories
especially when we feel an affinity to the heroine
