' because i was awake all the time i had a staph infection , but i actually believed i might have bugs in my eyes and when i went to hospital , i was having drug - induced psychosis , i would say i had mites in my eyes or fleas or bugs , ' ms @entity0 told @entity41
' not once was i ever asked '' are you on meth or taking drugs or are you having a drug induced psychosis '' or '' should we get a social worker or a psych assessment ''
' i do n't know if they were trying to protect me because i was in the ambulance service , but either way they should n't have been protecting me because firstly , i was dealing with people and patients and secondly , like anyone else i deserve the best treatment and care
' i should have never been allowed to be released so many times without a psych consultation or councillor
