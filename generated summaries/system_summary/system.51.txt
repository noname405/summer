on a fenced - in artificial pitch , on the edge of one of @entity4 's most notorious estates , a group of men with what you could call lived - in faces are finishing a game of football
some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots
stories of strife are swapped
' i 'm only here so i can get a shower , ' says one as he rolls a cigarette
' the wife booted me out a week ago and i 've been on a settee since
' @entity26 helped coach youngsters from @entity30 's @entity29 project another is reflecting on how this kickabout , for those who may have suffered from mental health issues , is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink
' i was on a bridge over a motorway , ' he says as he looks into the distance
' they sectioned me for five years
' into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity
@entity26 , he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast , is back in @entity50
the @entity51 , now 0, was a key cog in sir @entity54 's treble - winning machine , making 0appearances in that memorable season following a # 4.4 m switch from @entity58
the midfielder -lrb- left -rrb- was a crucial player in @entity30 's treble winning season of 0- 0but his 0minutes in the late , late @entity63 win over @entity64 in @entity65 would be his last in a red shirt
three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to @entity70 but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement
he is here on sunday to coach youngsters from the @entity30 's @entity76 project , but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch
@entity26 now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences the years have been kind
@entity26 's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs

' @entity26 celebrates their semi-final win over @entity104 with @entity105 -lrb- centre -rrb- and @entity107 @entity26 had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for @entity30 in 0
he was one of few players sir @entity54 had to try more than once to convince to move to the club , after he spurned the @entity112 's advances to sign for @entity58 and @entity113 after a frustrating year on @entity115 's bench
' i liked @entity116 , ' he explains , apologetically
' it was nothing to do with @entity50
