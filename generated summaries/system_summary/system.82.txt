@entity0 hopes to lure more people to use its new @entity3 0software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they 're already using on @entity7 or @entity9 phones
the move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world 's biggest software company , which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones , partly because of a lack of apps
the company said at its annual build conference on wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their @entity7 and @entity9 apps to run on devices that use the new @entity3 0operating system coming late this year

@entity0 also announced a new name for the web browser that it plans to offer with @entity3 0
the company promises its new ' edge ' browser is faster and more useful than the internet explorer that @entity0 has offered for the last 0years
the tech giant is making its case for @entity3 0before an army of software developers who may be crucial allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm among consumers for the next version of @entity0 's flagship operating system , coming later this year
' our goal is to make @entity3 0the most attractive development platform ever , ' @entity0 executive @entity66 told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers
while @entity0 has already previewed some aspects of the new @entity3 , a parade of top executives is using the build conference to demonstrate more software features and app - building tools , with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as @entity81 ultimately , they 're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on rival operating systems from @entity86 and @entity7
during the three - day conference , @entity0 is also expected to show off new @entity3 smartphones or other devices and reveal more details about such tech initiatives as the company 's new @entity93 web browser ; its @entity96 - like digital assistant known as @entity97 ; and the @entity98 , a futuristic ' augmented reality ' headset that projects three - dimensional images in a wearer 's field of vision
but perhaps most importantly , this year 's conference is an opportunity for @entity0 to persuade an audience of more than 5,000 techies and independent programmers that it 's worth their time to create new apps and programs for @entity3 0
experts say @entity0 needs a rich variety of apps if it wants to appeal to people who are increasingly using mobile gadgets instead of personal computers

internet explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers , attaining a peak of about 0per cent during 0and 0
however , it struggled in the face of competition , and in may 0it was announced that @entity86 's @entity134 overtook @entity123 as the most used browser worldwide
the brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of internet explorer 0, which was notoriously insecure
' getting developer buy - in is absolutely the crucial thing , ' said @entity141 , a tech industry analyst at @entity143
he said @entity0 has struggled with a ' chicken - and - egg ' problem , in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for @entity3 because relatively few people use @entity3 phones and tablets
@entity0 hopes it has solved that problem by designing @entity3 0so it 's easier for developers to build ' universal ' apps that work on a variety of @entity3 devices , from phones to pcs and other gadgets , @entity141 said
currently , there are more than 1.4 million apps for @entity9 phones and about the same for @entity7 devices , while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on @entity3 phones and tablets
the company also has a big carrot to wave in front of those developers : @entity0 has already said it will release @entity3 0as a free upgrade to people who now have pcs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of
