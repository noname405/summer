' there 's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that , ' he insisted
' it was just an absolute shocker
i just ca n't work out what he was thinking
' it was just idiotic how he did n't see it
it was n't a conspiracy , i just ca n't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close
' there is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head , he must be an idiot not to see it
