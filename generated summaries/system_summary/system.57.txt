@entity1 manager @entity0 says he would have no problem with sneaking through the ` back door ' into @entity5 football via the @entity6
the @entity1 started the season strongly and looked a good bet for @entity5 qualification around @entity10 before their form fell away , with a mid-table finish now all - but certain
but a reprieve could be granted by the @entity6 , with @entity0 's side topping the @entity16 table for their good behaviour , just ahead of @entity18
if @entity1 finish top of the pile and @entity23 's top flight is within the top three ` fair - playing ' leagues in @entity25 -- which it was on last count - they will earn a @entity29 place
@entity0 's @entity1 are top of the @entity31 table , sitting just above @entity18 the @entity1 have won once in their last 0league matches and drew 0- 0against @entity33 in their last match where do the @entity36 teams stand ? 0
@entity40 qualification via @entity31 would see the @entity1 enter the competition at the first qualifying round , playing their first game on july 0and competing in up to six games before the @entity16 season even starts
but @entity0 , who takes his charges to face champions @entity39 on sunday , just wants to qualify and does n't care how he does it , or when the season restarts
` it 's a headache but you 've got to take the opportunity if it arises , ' he said
` it might be seen as the back door , -lrb- but -rrb- it 's an opportunity to play in @entity25
` i think every player wants , not come back that bit earlier , but certainly to play in @entity25 because this club has n't been in that position to play in @entity25 for a long time
' @entity0 's @entity60 future hangs in the balance with his contract expiring in the summer and a section of fans demanding he is replaced at the end of the season , but he has already been involved in meetings concerning pre-season plans
@entity0 is out of contract at @entity1 in the summer which leaves his managerial future in the balance ` the difficulty is the fact that we do n't know when , yet , whether we 're going to finish in that spot , ' he said
` and so we 've already planned for either
one in it and one out of it , and obviously if we 're in it we 're back earlier , a few days earlier
if we 're out of it -lrb- the @entity29 -rrb- we come back on july 0, which is one of the smallest close seasons we 've had in a long time
` and even then international players wo n't be back on that date , either earlier or on the first of july because they wo n't be finished international duties until the middle of june
