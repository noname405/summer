taxpayers are having to find # 11billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs
the money , which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved , is paid to some 5.2 million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits
campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table
the total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax , according to the study by citizens @entity30
critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages the charity is campaigning for the adoption of the @entity42 - # 9.15 an hour in @entity43 and # 7.85 for the rest of the @entity30 - across both the public and private sector
it estimates this would reduce the need for in - work benefits by # 6.7 bn a year , which would make a massive dent in the # 12billion reduction in welfare spending which the @entity54 say is necessary
the current minimum wage for those over 0is # 6.50 an hour and will rise to # 6.70 in october , but this is well below what the government accepts is needed by many people , particularly those with children , to make ends meet
the charity 's report complains : ` the public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages
' its report says @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 's posted combined profits of # 3.9 bn last year , but between them cost the taxpayer more than # 750m in benefits paid to their staff
@entity70 paid # 519m in tax but received # 364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low - paid workers
@entity71 spent # 150m in tax but its 120,000 low - paid workers received # 221m in benefits
