on paper @entity1 's team sheet looked like an insult , one for the anti-football brigade to get their beaks into after @entity6 went without an orthodox striker
when reality bites , even his biggest detractors must concede that @entity6 's decision to leave @entity11 on the bench until the start of the second half was another tactical masterclass
@entity1 's manager is staying true to the game -- his game -- because the end result will be a fourth @entity21 title for this football club
@entity1 's @entity6 gestures on the sideline after going into the game against @entity25 without a striker @entity27 was part of a front three who interchanged roles during the first half to great effect for their boss at times you are left wondering what @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity27 make of it all when @entity6 starts working on team shape six days before a clash with @entity25
this trio have an element of fantasy about their game , with those delightful touches around the corner and the clever wall passes that they can play at will
the master simply wants results
to start without a striker , to ignore the collective groans around the country by starting @entity36 in a deeply withdrawn role behind @entity35 and @entity27 , was a statement of intent
@entity6 was forced into it , of sorts , because he has been deprived of @entity58 and @entity59 in recent weeks , and his warrior @entity11 could not train all week
even so , you would not put it past @entity6 -- who pulled a similar stunt by playing @entity65 as a false nine at @entity66 last season -- to have done it anyway
when it comes to work - rate , discipline and desire , no - one can accuse these players of cheating
everyone has a job to do in this team
@entity1 mastermind @entity6 surveys the pitch before kick - off having plotted out his game plans @entity35 leads a trio with @entity36 and @entity27 that has fantasy about their play but @entity6 wants function strikers @entity59 -lrb- left -rrb- and @entity58 are both working their way back to fitness with leg injuries to watch @entity35 , the @entity89 player of the year , @entity27 and @entity36 sacrifice their a-game for the greater good of the team demonstrates a unique commitment to @entity6 's methods
what happened to the style , the swagger and the pomp about the team who won so handsomely at @entity103 , putting five past @entity105 's side without reply at the @entity107 on january 0? they traded it for @entity6 's tactics , using the extra time during the week following their @entity113 elimination against @entity114 for match - specific preparation
with only one game a week since @entity1 went out on away goals on march 0, @entity6 has used the time on the training field to prepare for @entity21 matches as a one - off
but @entity11 was available to @entity6 and he only used the @entity121 when @entity27 went off injured there is no question who had the upper hand in the managerial tactical battle , and it was n't wenger @entity36 was exceptional for his manager , pestering the @entity25 midfield when the @entity129 were without the ball @entity131 comes close after a ball into the box from @entity36 but is thwarted by @entity25 keeper @entity134 against @entity66 he deliberately conceded possession , suffocating @entity136 and waited to hit @entity138 's team on the break
they won 0- 0, even if it was far from pretty
