the 0- year - old @entity5 prop had not scored a try for almost 0months but went over twice in the first half to help the @entity9 table toppers to their fifth win in a row
@entity3 's last home win against the @entity5 was a 0- 0@entity14 victory at @entity15 in november 0and their wait goes on after a 0- 0loss
but their depleted side turned in a battling show , trailing 0- 0at half - time , before slipping to only their second defeat in the last eight games
@entity0 broke his try drought with a double for @entity1 in their win over @entity3 on sunday full - back @entity28 followed up his two - try show against @entity31 with another brace with the @entity34 other touchdown from @entity35
@entity0 crossed for his side 's first two tries before @entity38 , the outstanding @entity39 and @entity40 went in to seal a hard - fought win in difficult conditions
@entity3 , already without the suspended @entity43 and @entity44 , were shorn of another six regulars but coach @entity46 was not taking the voluntary option to rest any of his players before saturday 's cup tie at @entity50
his hand was forced with @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and brothers @entity56 and @entity58 all injured
@entity46 handed debuts to under - 0captain @entity61 - cousin of @entity62 - and 0- year - old @entity63 with the back - row pair starting in the bench
apart from injured wingers @entity67 and @entity68 , the @entity5 were also missing @entity69 against the club where he started as a junior , @entity71 and @entity72
@entity73 used the strong wind to his advantage from the start with his kick off blowing back to give his side possession
but handling errors by @entity0 and @entity38 gave @entity3 confidence although @entity1 had the first chance to go ahead after 0minutes
@entity82 spilled a pass in the wind with @entity84 pouncing on the loose ball 0metres out but was hauled down by @entity86
the @entity5 did manage to go in front after 0minutes when @entity0 charged over from close range after @entity3 conceded back - to - back penalties with @entity73 tagging on the conversion
but the @entity34 hit back immediately with @entity86 ' side - stepping run sending sub @entity35 over with @entity92 's kick levelling the scores
then @entity28 shot through the @entity1 defence to fire @entity3 into a 0- 0lead
@entity0 struck again to level at 0- 0after being the quickest to react to @entity97 's grubber kick
@entity3 thought they had regained the advantage four minutes before the break when @entity40 failed to gather @entity92 's towering kick in the gale and @entity103 collected the ball to race over
but referee @entity105 ruled @entity103 was offside before he was forced to hold up play when an advertising hoarding blew onto the pitch
the wind then came to the @entity5 aid with kicks by @entity112 and @entity113 held back by the conditions for @entity38 to cross in the corner and make it 0- 0at half - time
@entity38 looked suspiciously offside for his try and it had been a valiant effort by the @entity34 before the break
