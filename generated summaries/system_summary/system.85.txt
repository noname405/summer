the body of @entity1 , naked from the waist down , was discovered in a bathroom at his gated , three - storey # 2.6 million villa in the @entity5 on tuesday afternoon
the @entity7 neighbourhood is home to many of @entity11 's most powerful players , but @entity1 's surname was all that was needed to ensure his entry into that social set
the 0- year - old grandson of @entity16 , once the world 's richest man , @entity1 was an heir to the vast getty oil fortune
lurid early reports of his death and troubled past suggest a new chapter has opened in the tragic history of a family that epitomises , like no other , the saying that money does n't bring you happiness
a string of @entity44 have died from drug overdoses , while another grandson of the family patriarch , @entity47 , never recovered after he became the victim of a notorious and brutal kidnapping
other members of the supremely dysfunctional family became embroiled in decades long lawsuits and divorces , always over money
even @entity1 's father , @entity55 , a supposedly squeaky - clean married philanthropist and classical composer , was mired in scandal when it emerged he had a secret second family
in this latest tragedy , police say a woman called them to @entity1 's home on tuesday , saying that the horror movie buff had suffered a heart attack
investigators say he had been having severe stomach problems and suffered significant bleeding in his rectal area
however , they believe he died of natural causes or an accident
@entity1 's former girlfriend , identified in the @entity74 media as aspiring actress @entity75 , 0, raised the alarm
reportedly she had told him to see a doctor about ` painful bowel movements '
@entity1 's former girlfriend , identified in the @entity74 media as aspiring actress @entity75 , 0, raised the alarm though investigators do not regard her as a suspect , she allegedly has a history of psychiatric problems and has been arrested a number of times for harassment and disorderly conduct
reports in @entity74 suggest that according to police insiders , officers had previously been called to the house 0times , usually over domestic disturbances
@entity75 and @entity1 were frequently under the influence of drugs when officers visited
then two weeks ago , @entity98 took out a restraining order against her , the @entity7 police said yesterday
at the same time as he took out the order , he said he had a serious medical condition and that doctors had warned him that ` heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously ' , putting him at ` serious risk '
twelve years ago , when @entity98 was being sued over a disagreement with a former employee , he was portrayed in court by ex-colleagues on a film he directed as a threatening , cocaine - snorting gun nut
educated at the private @entity114 in @entity115 , he later studied at @entity116 and the @entity117
intriguingly , records show he has been prosecuted 0times for unpaid taxes
