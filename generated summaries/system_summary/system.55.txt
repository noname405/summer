@entity0 , who scored 0goals on loan at @entity11 before joining @entity1 from @entity12 in january for # 2million , pounced after 0minutes to cancel out a 21st - minute own goal from @entity14
it was a vital strike from @entity16 as the @entity18 side were heading for a third successive defeat which would have all but ended their play - off hopes
@entity1 striker @entity0 volleys home an equaliser for the home side at @entity8 to keep them in the @entity6 play - off hunt @entity1 -lrb- 0- 0- 0-rrb- : @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity14 , @entity29 ; van @entity30 -lrb- @entity32 0-rrb- , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity16 subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 scorer : @entity45 0booked : dicko @entity7 -lrb- 0- 0- 0-rrb- : @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 -lrb- @entity53 0-rrb- , @entity54 , @entity55 -lrb- @entity56 0-rrb- ; @entity57 , @entity58 -lrb- @entity59 0-rrb- subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 scorer : @entity65 0booked : @entity52 , @entity54 referee : @entity67 while @entity1 are just about still alive in the promotion race , @entity7 remain well placed for a top - six finish despite failing to hold on to the advantage they were presented by @entity14
@entity7 boss @entity72 , who was in charge at @entity1 for almost six years before being sacked in february 0, has steered them to 0points and knows that winning their final two games of the season would secure a place in the play - offs
@entity8 manager @entity81 had wanted a frenetic start and he got that through quick striker @entity36
@entity36 had been left out of the starting line - up for the previous game at @entity86 and he looked like he had a point to prove following his recall , with pace which tormented @entity48 and his central defensive partner , @entity1 old boy @entity49
however , the hosts failed to make the most of his efforts and @entity7 were able to ride out the storm before taking the lead
@entity96 international @entity48 rose above the @entity1 defence and met a corner from @entity55 that was glanced goalwards and deflected into his own net by the luckless @entity14
wolves took time to come to terms with falling behind and when they finally did force an attack of note @entity36 saw his 33rd - minute shot blocked by @entity49
that sparked @entity81 's team back into life and they were unlucky not to draw level six minutes before half - time when @entity7 failed to clear their lines
the ball fell invitingly on the edge of the area to @entity33 , whose volley looked set to sneak just inside the post before @entity46 tipped it away for a corner
wolves took that freshly found momentum into the start of the second half and , after @entity36 flashed a header from a @entity35 cross just wide , @entity0 continued his prolific spell in front of goal
@entity126 's low drive was deflected into the path of @entity0 , who reacted brilliantly to force the ball home at the far post
with parity restored , @entity1 carried more of a threat and @entity49 found himself working overtime to try and keep the dangerous @entity36 in check
