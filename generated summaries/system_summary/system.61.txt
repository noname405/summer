there comes a moment where numbers do n't stop us , it goes beyond that , even if the @entity40 press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself
' for the future , i do n't know more than you do , because i will always go where i am offered new challenges
that is in my nature
' when i arrived at @entity4 , -lsb- @entity50 -rsb- @entity49 was not the coach
just like the players , managers arrive and leave
as i have said before , i owe it to the @entity4 fans to fight until the end of my career at this club
' my decisions will not be affected by changes in management , but more by the challenges that will be offered to me
' @entity4 find themselves fourth in the @entity7 table after a dismal run of form and out of the @entity66 after a two - legged defeat by @entity68 at the last 0stage

football is my passion , my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as i can
