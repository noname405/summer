' @entity0 's time of two minutes 09:51 seconds was the fastest recorded in the world this year the performance of @entity0 , who won 100m freestyle gold on tuesday , is particularly impressive considering the heavy disruptions to her winter training programme
the pool at the @entity42 , where the 0- year - old has trained for most of her career , has been closed for six months renovation meaning she and her group have been forced to relocate 0miles away at @entity47
' it has been hard over the last six months , ' @entity0 added
' it has been a challenge but everyone has challenges in sport
' it 's just something we have to deal with
it could n't have been any better and i 'm proud to have adapted to it
' it 's definitely been tough , we 've all felt that
our pool is open in @entity62 after this though so i 'm looking forward to getting back there and getting some consistency again
