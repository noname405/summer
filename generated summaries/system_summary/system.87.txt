Article: 
the @entity0 could be suffering from shifts in its biochemical balance similar to those believed to have wiped out half of all life 0million years ago
this is according to a @entity9 study that has discovered a catastrophic condition called ' marine photic zone euxinia ' took place in one of the prehistoric oceans
this happens when the sun - lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulphide
life of the @entity22 met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate , heating the seas into warm stagnation , according to a new study
pictured is an artist 's impression of what may have happened in the oceans 0million years ago
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences hydrogen sulphide is a by - product of micro-organisms that live without oxygen and is extremely toxic to most other lifeforms
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the amount of carbon dioxide being created through the burning of fossil fuels
a team lead by the @entity48 studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north - eastern @entity52 , which surrounded the continent of @entity54
the rocks are now exposed on the @entity56 , off the coast of @entity58 , @entity59
a team lead by the @entity48 studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north - eastern @entity52
the rocks are now exposed on the @entity56 , off the coast of @entity58 , @entity59 the experts found signs of bacteria which had suffered severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide poisoning which would have been caused by massive volcanic rifts in the @entity0 's tectonic plates
' as tectonic plates shifted to break up @entity54 , huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect , ' said professor @entity76
' the rapid rises in @entity78 would have triggered changes in ocean circulation , acidification and deoxygenation
the @entity52 was the vast global ancestral @entity83 that surrounded the supercontinent @entity54 , during the @entity85 and the early @entity87 eras ' these changes have the potential to disrupt nutrient cycles and alter food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems
our data now provides direct evidence that anoxic , and ultimately euxinic , conditions severely affected food chains
' the same @entity78 rise that led to the oxygen - depleted oceans also led to a mass extinction on land , and ultimately to the ecological takeover by dinosaurs , although the mechanisms are still under study
' she explained that although the @entity0 was very different during the @entity22 period , the rate of carbon dioxide release from volcanic rifts are similar to those we are experiencing now through the burning of fossil fuels
professor @entity76 added : ' the release of @entity78 was probably at least as rapid as that caused by the burning of fossil fuels today , although the initial concentrations were much higher in the @entity22
