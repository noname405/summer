with just over a week to go until the @entity0 hits her due date , preparations for the new arrival at her @entity5 home , dubbed ' @entity6 ' , have been heating up
@entity7 , the new arrival 's grandmother , has become a permanent fixture at the country home , while in the nursery , nanny @entity12 is preparing to welcome a second charge
but while much of the effort has focused on @entity16 and making sure he does n't feel left out , more still has gone in to giving the nursery a makeover
fittings for both are thought have come from luxury children 's furniture emporium , @entity34 of @entity35 , where @entity37 baskets start at # 0
but in a curious twist , it is understood that @entity0 had several pots of pink paint delivered to @entity42 from the @entity43 store a couple of weeks ago
in a move certain to invite further speculation over the sex of the baby , among colours chosen was @entity49 , which is described as a ' beautiful rich complex pink with a hint of lilac
' another was @entity55 , a ' soft pale pink with a hint of brown ' that is redolent of ' old - fashioned roses and the colour of old plaster ' and the third , @entity62 , a ' warm soft aubergine colour with pink and red undertones '
home : the new baby will spend its first few weeks at his or her parents ' @entity5 home , @entity42 @entity72 pad : the new arrival will also have the run of a second nursery at @entity27 each pot comes with a price tag fit for a royal , with just one litre of the paint costing # 18.95
@entity27 refused to comment on the story saying that they could neither ' confirm ' nor ' deny ' that the couple had plans to paint the nursery
echoing the palace 's line , a spokesman for @entity87 said the company could not ` confirm or deny ' that it had supplied paints to @entity42
nonetheless , a pink nursery appears more likely than the @entity93 - themed one hinted at by @entity94 in an interview with @entity96
' i 'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room , ' he joked
' we 'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that , make him grow up as if he 's in the bush
' boy or girl ? @entity0 's pink coat and pink paints have fuelled speculation over the new baby 's sex compelling : @entity87 has supplied three feminine paint samples to @entity42 whatever the nursery 's eventual colour , more work still has gone in to turning @entity42 into a secluded property where @entity16 - and his new sibling - can enjoy a relatively normal childhood
the refurbishment , which has taken two years and cost # 1.5 million , has seen new security features added to the ten bedroom property which also has a swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds
as part of the costly renovations -- which also included installing a new roof , a state - of - the - art kitchen and a conservatory -- @entity94 had the driveway to the property , which used to belong to his close friends the @entity140 family , rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees
more money has been spent on filling the royal nursery and with both @entity147 known to have traditional tastes , it 's safe to say that that extends to the toy box
@entity16 has been cutting his teeth on old - fashioned wooden toys , while his reading material includes the @entity155 books - the first of which was published in the 1950s
toys for the new baby will be no exception and are likely to have a homespun wholesome feel much like this # 0@entity162
prepared : the @entity163 and @entity0 also have plenty of pieces left over from @entity16 traditional : the @entity163 and @entity0 have traditional tastes and prefer old - fashioned toys one for @entity155 : the couple were presented with a @entity170 and @entity171 box when @entity155 was born tally ho ! both royal children are likely to start riding as soon as they are big enough , much like the queen @entity0 , who has made no secret of her liking for traditional fittings such as @entity37 baskets , is also likely to follow suit when it comes to toy boxes
indeed , the couple already own one , having been gifted a # 0@entity170 and @entity171 toy box by 0@entity184 following @entity16 's birth
