@entity0 will make his first appearance since finishing second in the masters in the @entity4 , an event where he has an impressive recent record
former @entity9 champion @entity8 , who was joint second with @entity11 behind @entity12 at @entity13 , has not been outside the top 0on his last three outings at @entity15
since missing the cut in 0, the 0- year - old @entity17 star has finished 10th , 15th and eighth and is a total of 0under par , with his last 0rounds all at par or better
@entity0 finished joint second in the masters at @entity13 earlier this month @entity8 returns to action at the @entity4 at @entity15 this week @entity8 will play alongside two other players who performed well in the masters for the first two rounds , world number 0@entity29 finishing 12th and @entity31 - 28th in his first tournament of 0
@entity31 underwent back surgery in december last year and will continue to play a limited schedule as he works his way back to full fitness , but the 0- year - old has not given up hope of another @entity17 appearance even though the @entity40 looms when he turns 0
' no matter what tournament i go to i want to be prepared and to play well and this is no different , ' @entity31 told a pre-tournament press conference
' even though it 's only my second event , i have high expectations of what i can do and what i should do
so i come here thinking that i can play well , but deep down i know it 's a process and i 've got some work to do
@entity8 looks on as @entity12 celebrates becoming @entity51 champion earlier this month ' i 'm probably a little more relaxed with things now than i was say 0years ago when i was trying to find my game
i would say that i 'm more comfortable in my own skin and what i do out here on tour is just kind of bonus
' i 've kind of relaxed my schedule the last few years , so that 's probably why i have this attitude about playing
i 'm much more excited to play when i do come to an event because i 'm not playing as much
i enjoy my time at home probably more so because i 'm spending bigger blocks of time at home
@entity31 -lrb- right -rrb- is making his way back to full fitness after back surgery last december and will also play in the @entity4 ' so right now i have really the best of both worlds and that 's what i 'll continue to do all the way up to the senior tour when i start playing some of that
' i 'm still very competitive though
i say i 'm pretty relaxed and casual with things
but when it comes down to it , i really still want to win again and play well and maybe make another team event before all is said and done
so i still have some drive in there
