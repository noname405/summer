a @entity1 firm has given new meaning to the phrase ' beauty sleep ' by creating a pillowcase which is being touted as the latest way to keep wrinkles at bay
the $ 0-lrb- # 0-rrb- cloth cover - which comes with a lifetime guarantee - is said to hydrate the face and prevent lines while you sleep
and unlike a normal cotton pillowcase , which apparently sucks moisture from the skin , the @entity15 's special blend of ' hydrophobic fibres ' keeps the complexion hydrated all night

according to its description online , a traditional cotton case has a ' rough surface ' that ' siphons moisture ' away , leaving the face dry and dull
but the wrinkle preventing version is ' therapeutic and extra-smooth ' , redirecting moisture back into the skin for a more vibrant , healthier - looking appearance in the morning
they say the machine washable silky pillowcase also helps skin stay smooth , thanks to its 22,000 densely woven micro-filaments that prevent friction and remain taut
they thwart the bunching and pressure that cause standard cases to inscribe sleep lines , ' which can develop into permanent wrinkles '
another creation from @entity31 , which also comes with a lifetime guarantee , is the @entity60
the # 0@entity60 is said to banish face and chest wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side it is said to banish facial and chest sleep wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side
contoured like a butterfly with strategically placed cut - outs on either side and a supportive front wing , the soft , lightweight pillow 's polyurethane foam gently elevates the face and chest , preventing contact with the bed or pillow below
this apparently helps remove pressure on facial muscles which , as @entity85 cautions , can result in pillow wrinkles , creases , and puffiness
the lower wings elevate and support the head , shoulders and arms allowing for a comfortable back sleeping position in a way that ca n't be achieved on a conventional pillow
use alone or as a pillow topper with an existing pillow
